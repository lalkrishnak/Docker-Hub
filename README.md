# Docker-Hub
Repo that contains all docker related files

Keep in mind that Docker is not the first and not the only containerization platform. However, at the moment Docker is the biggest and the most powerful player on the market.

## The list of benefits of Docker are the following:
* Faster development process. There is no need to install 3rd parties like PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch. Those can be run in containers.
* Handy application encapsulation (you can deliver your application in one piece).
* Same behaviour on local machine / dev / stage / production servers.
* Easy and clear monitoring.
* Easy to scale (if youâ€™ve done your application right it will be ready to scaling not only in Docker).
